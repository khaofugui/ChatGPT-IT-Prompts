# ChatGPT-IT-Prompts
As the most focused technology in early 2023, ChatGPT-the groundbreaking AI service released by OpenAI, was named to be the iPhone moment of the AI industry. Other AI companies' reactions varied. For instance, Google accelerated their product development to face the challenge of ChatGPT. And Fudan introduced a so-called local language version of a ChatGPT-like product. And the others just adjusted their product roadmap to join the ChatGPT eco-system and covet to ride the waves of ChatGPT to revitalize the AI industry, which had started to downturn since last year.

I was astonished by the ChatGPT performance, specifically its coding ability. It can generate precise codes ready to execute only with minor modifications if you specify clear and concise prompts. From developing a machine learning model, generating a toy dataset, and automatically getting insights from input data. Besides the assistance for programming, it provides a vast range of support for professional services in other industries. It's the first time that AI techniques practically engaged in everyone's daily life.

I created this repository to collect awesome Chinese ChatGPT prompts in IT usage. Not only the pure prompts in text, and I also enclosed with relative dataset and generated codes from ChatGPT. I tested the principles in Jupyter Notebook to make sure they could run smoothly with running logs. You could download the codes and dataset and regenerate the same result as mine on your premise. It would help you to get the most out of ChatGPT and increase your skill with this secret weapon that may dominate personal development in the future. AI won't replace you, but the people who master AI tools will.
